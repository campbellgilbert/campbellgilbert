howdy! i'm campbell, and i'm a senior at occidental college & caltech. i'm getting my bachelor's in computer science with a minor in english in a few months. i do a lot of fun cool stuff; currently i'm working on a benchmark to evaluate LLM feedback on analytical essays (for school), and a seinfeld-themed reverse turing test to assess how effective people are at differentiating between vision model-generated and meatspace-photographed images (for fun). another side project is the website i made for my childhood au pair in nepal. 

my biggest project is RAVENDESK which is in my senior comps repo, it's an AI-powered word processor that i worked really hard on and i think is very cool. the senior comps repo pinned below has that project and the 10pg research paper i wrote on the topic!

i know a lot of computer languages (python, c#, java, c, js) and i have a particular interest in large language & vision models. some fun facts about me are that i have really terrible handwriting, i can untie any knot, and my favorite color is lilac. i'm also a researcher on the moore lab obird project, which i'm super proud of! you can find some of my models here: https://sketchfab.com/MooreLab/collections/moore-lab-of-zoology-a0098d4ddd224fda921d749c788aa90c

this repo has my past projects for my courses*, my resume (linked below), and some personal work as mentioned above. 

*machine learning, graphics, game design, algorithms analysis, etc.

thanks for reading! i'd love it if you said hi.
