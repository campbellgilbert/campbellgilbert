Hi! I'm Campbell, a sophomore at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and I'm studying computer science.

I have a lot of experience with Java; as of this writing, I'm just beginning to work with C and assembly languages like MIPS.
I don't have a whole lot on this site just yet, but I'm excited to build cool programs to put on here!
Some projects I'm thinking about working on right now include...
- a Firefox extention that displays the length and time of each of your classes so you know how much time you have left, with options to modify colors to suit your needs
- learning HTML
- AND MANY MORE!

Thank you for reading! I'd love it if you said hi, and there's a whole lot of places to do just that:
