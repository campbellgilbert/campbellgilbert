Hi! I'm Campbell (she/they), a junior at Occidental College in Los Angeles. I'm planning to earn my B.A. in Computer Science and A.A.s in English and Math by May 2024.

I have a lot of experience with Python, C, C#, and Java, as well as some experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This site contains my past projects for Machine Learning, Graphics, Game Design, and Data Structures, and will be periodically updated with work done for my courses (currently  enrolled in Algorithms Analysis), as well as personal work. I'm hoping to create my own website soon where I can upload the Blender models I've created. I'm excited to put more cool stuff on here! 

Thank you for reading! I'd love it if you said hi, and here's a whole lot of places to do just that:
