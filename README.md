Hi! I'm Campbell, a junior at Occidental College in Los Angeles. I'm planning to earn my B.A. in Computer Science and minor in English.

I have a lot of experience with Java, C, C#, and Python; as of this writing, I'm just beginning to work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This site contains my past projects for Machine Learning and will be periodically updated with work done for my courses as well as personal work. I'm excited to put more cool stuff on here! 

Thank you for reading! I'd love it if you said hi, and there's a whole lot of places to do just that:
