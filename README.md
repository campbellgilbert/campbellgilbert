I'm a senior at Occidental College in Los Angeles. I'm planning to earn my B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in English by Spring 2024; I'm also taking courses at CalTech.

I have a lot of experience with Python, C, C#, and Java, as well as some experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This site contains my past projects for Algorithms Analysis, Machine Learning, Graphics, Game Design, and Data Structures, and will be periodically updated with work done for my courses, as well as personal work. I've also worked on the Moore Lab of Zoology OBird project.

Thank you for reading! I'd love it if you said hi.
